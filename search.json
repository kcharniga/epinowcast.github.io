    "text": "Abstract\nThe generation interval, defined as the time between when an individual becomes infected and when they infect another person, is a fundamental quantity describing the infection process. However, measuring generation intervals in practice can be challenging because infection events are rarely observed. Instead, serial intervals, defined as the time between when an individual develops symptoms and when their infectee develops symptoms, are often used as a substitute. In this talk, I explain how generation and serial intervals can vary across time and space during an epidemic. I also discuss how different interventions affect their distributions."

    "section": "The indicator and the challenge",
    "text": "The indicator and the challenge\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemiological indicators have become part of our everyday life. Early on, deaths were the only reliable measure in many places. Then, for a long time, we were staring at case numbers, and later measures of healthcare burden became central. In Germany, where I work, the 7-day COVID-19 hospitalization incidence became a central indicator in Fall 2021 (with thresholds linked to levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions). However, this indicator has its peculiarities and quickly prompted some public debate (see e.g., this automatic translation of a German-language news item). One difficulty (I’ll gloss over a few other questions) is its timeliness. The issue arises from its very definition: the 7-day hopitalization incidence is (roughly speaking) the number of people who were reported to have a positive COVID-19 test during said 7-day period and later, and not necessarily during the same 7 days, got admitted to hospital. So hospitalizations are counted by when a positive test rather than when the actual hospitalization was reported. This way, in addition to the classical reporting delay, a second delay is baked into the indicator - the time it takes from a positive test to hospitalization. As a consequence, it can take a really long time until data are finally complete. Especially recent values are biased downwards and one can easily get the impression of a downward trend where there isn’t actually one. We therefore figured that statistical nowcasting - predicting what the numbers will look like once all data are complete - was a really relevant task here.\n\n\n\nIllustration of data updates and the nowcasting tasks. Coloured lines show data as available at different point in time. Blue lines and shaded areas show the nowcasts issued in real time. A clear downward dip at the end of each version of the time series is visible, which disappears when data are revised."

    "text": "The collaborative format\nIf you are in the epidemic modelling sphere, you may have come across the various COVID-19 Forecast Hubs which bring together epidemiological predictions from various models, systematically compare them and merge them into so-called ensembles. While one conclusion from these efforts is that predicting COVID-19 is really hard, a more positive finding is that combining different models can somewhat enhance performance (see e.g., here and here). When the political decision was taken to make the 7-day hospitalization incidence the main pandemic indicator in Germany, we figured it was an interesting setting to apply this approach to nowcasting. Specifically, we had two goals:\n\nWhile Robert Koch Institute, the German Federal Public Health Institute, was showing figures of nowcasts in its weekly reports, no operational and re-usable nowcasts were available to be displayed along with real-time data.\nWhen first looking into the problem, we realized that there was a large number of nowcasting methods, but little was known about their actual real-time behaviour nor their relative performance. Also, nobody had tried to combine several nowcasting models into an ensemble nowcast.\n\nWe therefore reached out to a few people we knew were working on related topics and set up a GitHub repository with pre-processed data as well as a visualization dashboard to make their contribution as easy as possible. People got on board astonishingly quickly and a few days later we had several nowcasting models up and running, and posted a study protocol for our methods comparison."

    "section": "The lessons",
    "text": "The lessons\nIf you are interested in the detailed results our preprint has you covered. I’ll just say a few words about my main learnings:\n\nReassuringly, all models we considered were doing something reasonable (see figure), and most of the time they were able to give a realistic idea of current trends. Every now and then, nowcasts were also considerably off. Typically, that happened when reporting practices changed, and most models were affected in a similar manner.\nOne of the main challenges was to get weekday effects under control (there are two of them - one for the date of positive test, one for the date of hospitalization). Our purposefully simple “reference model” KIT does not take this aspect into account and consequently looks like an ill-calibrated cardiogram.\n\n\n\n\nSame-day nowcasts (with a horizon of 0 days) of the 7-day hospitalization incidence as issued on each day of the study period. Nowcasts are shown for the German national level pooled across all age groups.\n\n\n\nUncertainty quantification turned out to be tricky. Almost none of the models issued prediction intervals reaching nominal coverage levels. One important learning was that purely model-based uncertainty quantification (like your model’s predictive posterior distribution) does not work all that well in practice. Two approaches which looked at errors of past nowcasts fared much better (sort of poor man’s versions of conformal prediction).\nDefining a nowcasting target is not as trivial as it seems. We somewhat naively defined it as “the final version of the time series”, which in practice we assumed would be available 100 days after the last day for which we generated nowcasts. However, it turned out that the data were still changing after these 100 days. Only slightly, but enough to have an impact on results. Looking back, rather than using the data version available on a specified date, a better idea might have been to define the target as all hospitalizations reported with a maximum delay of, say, 40 days.\nAs in similar previous projects, combined emsemble predictions showed promising results. On our pre-specified original target, they actually came in second and were beaten quite clearly by one of the individual models. That, however, seemed to be due to a peculiar overlay of a few different biases working in different directions (it’s a long discussion, check out the paper). Personally I am optimistic that across different settings there is something to be gained from ensemble nowcasts."

    "section": "How nowcasts have been used",
    "text": "How nowcasts have been used\nGiven the sudden prominence of the 7-day hospitalization incidence in the management of the pandemic in Germany, in fall and winter 2021 there was considerable interest in the nowcasts we made available. Many media outlets are now winding down their COVID dashboards, but e.g., at newspaper Die Zeit and public broadcaster NDR, the nowcasts are still routinely displayed in May 2023. Following some very productive exchange with colleagues from Robert Koch Institute, our platform has also been referred to in their weekly reports (accompanying their own nowcasts).\nAn interesting aspect in the exchange with data journalists was that they were sort of hesitant to use the ensemble nowcast. After all, it was based on a difficult-to-understand mix of methods, some of which not yet formally peer-reviewed. Understandably, for them it made sense to have one specific method to point to, published in a journal of known reputation. A positive experience was that at least some media outlets took care to communicate the uncertainty associated with nowcasts explicitly."

Our experiences throughout the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted substantial challenges in our field, including psychological pressures, gaps in institutional support, and systemic issues that pervade the academic and research landscape. Motivated by these challenges and committed to improving future response efforts, we, a group of 27 members from the UK infectious disease modelling community, convened for a reflective workshop in March 2023. This summary distils the key issues we identified and proposes strategies that we believe can enhance the effectiveness of our field in future epidemic responses. A full report on our methods and findings, including the anonymised individual feedback from workshop participants that informed our findings, is available."

    "section": "Discussion Themes",
    "text": "Discussion Themes\nTo identify overarching themes, we started with paired discussions, with each participant sharing their personal and professional pandemic experiences for 15 minutes. We then aggregated pairs into groups of increasing size in order to generalise personal experiences into themes. This approach fostered an understanding of the individual experiences that constituted our collective response effort.\nFollowing these discussions, we collectively identified and categorised emergent issues for epidemic response work into themes. These were:\n\nFunding and institutional support: Participants reported insufficient institutional support and contract insecurity due to reliance on external grant funding, impacting both academic and professional services roles. Recognitions, rewards, and access: Current reward metrics were deemed inadequate, with unequal credit attribution and limited access to policy-making spaces.\nTeam and work dynamics: Issues included insufficient capacity, competing demands, barriers to progression, and both positive and negative aspects of collaborative working.\nNon-academic contributions: The importance of professional services staff and collaboration with public health agency workers were highlighted.\nPersonal impacts: Public recognition led to both increased visibility and challenges; mental ill health and burnout were prevalent; balancing work with personal commitments was difficult for many.\n\nWe recognise that many of these issues impact those in our field outside of an epidemic response but believe that they are a particular issue for work of this kind. We also acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has engendered widespread hardship, stress, and ill health throughout various populations, and it is crucial to reflect on and address these profound impacts across all strata of society, not just in our community."

    "section": "Priority recommendations",
    "text": "Priority recommendations\nThe workshop proposed the following priority recommendations to improve support and sustainability for future epidemic response work:\n\nAcknowledge and reward impactful response work at institution, funder, and research community levels. For example, refining impact measures to credit all forms of output produced during, and required for, response work; institutions could incorporate response-driven work into criteria for doctoral theses and promotion.\nEncourage routine interaction between academia and public health agencies, including consistently reviewing the appropriate allocation of epidemic response tasks. One potential solution is creating sustainable dual positions recruiting from both sectors.\nEnsure response teams are well-staffed, well-resourced, stable, and provided psychological support. This approach reduces dependence on key individuals. One approach is to establish sustainable team-building and training programmes during non-response periods.\nIncrease the transparency of the evidence pathway from scientists to decision-makers. This makes it easier for those across the scientific community to contribute as well as making the evidence base for decisions clearer to the general public. This could be achieved by standardising rapid open access to the minutes of scientific advisory meetings.\nImplement best practices for a sustainable work environment. Employers and team leads can promote leave-taking and respecting work hours, clarify communication about processes and rewards across career stages, prepare for, and standardise, the onboarding of new team members, and integrate support roles.\n\nAchieving these changes necessitates investment from governments, funding bodies, and institutions. Teams may need to redefine their working methods to place greater emphasis on well-being, training, and career development. While localised initiatives require time investment from those leading them, they must be supported to foster a healthier and more sustainable environment for future epidemic response work.\nAs it stands, future epidemic responses are likely to raise similar challenges to those we have identified here, including reliance on a select number of individuals, excessive workloads and the exacerbation of systemic inequalities. It is critical we act outside of response contexts, for example by implementing the recommendations we have outlined, to mitigate these issues and respond more effectively in future."

Further investigations in other locations are recommended to broaden the scope of findings."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn June of 2022, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Mpox Response wanted timely answers to important epidemiological questions which can now be answered more effectively through infectious disease modeling. Infectious disease models have shown to be valuable tool for decision making during outbreaks; however, model complexity often makes communicating the results and limitations of models to decision makers difficult. We performed nowcasting and forecasting for the 2022 mpox outbreak in the United States using the R package EpiNow2. We generated nowcasts/forecasts at the national level, by Census region, and for jurisdictions reporting the greatest number of mpox cases. Modeling results were shared for situational awareness within the CDC Mpox Response and publicly on the CDC website. We retrospectively evaluated forecast predictions at four key phases during the outbreak using three metrics, the weighted interval score, mean absolute error, and prediction interval coverage. We compared the performance of EpiNow2 with a naïve Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM). The EpiNow2 model had less probabilistic error than the GLM during every outbreak phase except for the early phase. We share our experiences with an existing tool for nowcasting/forecasting and highlight areas of improvement for the development of future tools. We also reflect on lessons learned regarding data quality issues and adapting modeling results for different audiences."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBeginning in May 2022, Mpox virus spread rapidly in high-income countries through close human-to-human contact primarily amongst communities of gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men (GBMSM). The epidemiology of Mpox in the United Kingdom suggested that a full network model of sexual contacts could be an appropriate modelling framework for making inferences on key quantities (e.g. the risk of transmission per contact), generating probabilistic forecasts of the future Mpox trajectory and performing scenario-based projections. However, full network models are computationally intensive and complicated to calibrate, which in practical terms makes them difficult to operationalize. We present a stochastic discrete-population transmission model which includes GBMSM status, rate of formation of new sexual partnerships. The social structure underlying the transmission of Mpox was represented as a randomly sized clique partitioning of the population; which was inferred along with other parameters. Moreover, given increasingly wide-spread public awareness of Mpox over the summer of 2022, it seemed possible that actions taken by the public aimed at decreasing personal risk of contracting Mpox could impact the epidemic curve in the United Kingdom. Towards capturing this public response to the epidemic, we considered both individual behaviour change and uptake of the modified Vaccinia-based vaccine Imvanex/Jynneos."

    "text": "We run a monthly virtual seminar focussing on real-time modelling of infectious disease with the primary aim of connecting between different silos of knowledge (i.e. between mathematical modellers, statisticians, decision-makers, epidemiologists, and others).\nThis takes place on the first Wednesday of every month at 3pm UK time with recordings posted a week later on our community site alongside any discussion of the seminar.\nWe generally aim to fill the scheduled hour with talks ranging from 20-40 minutes followed by questions and community discussion.\nYou can see a list of scheduled speakers here. If interested in speaking yourself, or in helping to organise this seminar series, please reach out to Sam Abbott or Kelly Charniga (the current organisers).\nPlease do attend if interested in the real-time modelling of infectious disease."
